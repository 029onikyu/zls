# zls - Zig Language Server

Zig Language Server (or `zls` for short) is a - you guessed it - language server for Zig! Based off of the code written by the great `andersfr`.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperAuguste/zls
cd zls
zig build
```

Then, you can use the `zls` executable in an editor of your choice that has a Zig language server client!

## Usage

**Please, I beg you, please don't use this unless you're developing or testing it!**

### VSCode

Install the `zig-lsc` extension from [here](https://github.com/SuperAuguste/zig-lsc).
